**EnMUGR for Biological Networks Representation**

EnMUGR is a method to learn node representations for biological networks. It focuses on extracting effective and consistent information from heterogeneous networks. Low-dimensional representation features learned by the method can be used in general network-based inference problems.

The _run_demo.m_ provides an example for learning representation features with EnMUGR.
The _run_simulation.m_ provides a full case for running EnMUGR.
