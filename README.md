**EnMUGR:Learning Robust Representation from Multiple Biological Networks via Network Enhancement and Consistency Regularization**
EnMUGR is a method to learn node representations for biological network. It focuses on extracting efficient and consistent information from heterogeneous networks. Low-dimensional features learned by the method can be used in general network-based inference problems.

The _run_demo.m_ provides an example for running EnMUGR.
